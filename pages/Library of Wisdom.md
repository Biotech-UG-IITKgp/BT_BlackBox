## The Library of Wisdom

The repository of resources for people who are interested in exploring the field of Biotechnology.

It will contain posts aimed at introducing Undergrads with different available resources on the web (that we have found till now :P)

### Beginner resources worth checking out [_To Explore_]

1. [BioNinja](https://ib.bioninja.com.au/): An extremely informative website. Recommended to explore the topics of basic level biology.
2. [Amoeba Sisters](https://www.amoebasisters.com/): Actually, an excellent YouTube channel with videos that will help you visualize and understand concepts. (If you're into videos)

These resources are good if you are in your first year, without any previous knowledge of Biology and want to know whether you should start preparing for a Department Change :/
